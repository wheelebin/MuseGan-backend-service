# Notes
- Don't use pipenv (https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/)

# This version of torch
(1.7.0+cu101)

## Different states of this application
This project is used to train our model, run predictions on our model and handle restful API requests (responding with predictions).
I need to find a way to easily:
- Train
- Predict without API
- Start web service with access to predictions



## Prerequisites
* Make sure that you have python installed
* Make sure that you have the packages pip, virtualenv installed
* Install Fluidsynth
* Data
    * Download LPD dataset if creating new tensor dataset
    * Download .pt if loading existing tensor dataset for training model 
    * Download checkpoints loading exisiting model
    * Download synth files for midi2audo (Optional, this uses Fluidsynth)


## Installation Steps
1. Clone this repo & cd into it
2. Create a virtualenv & activate it
3. Install pip-tools
4. Run pip-sync to install packages
    * This torch version is installing with cuda, if you don't have a GPU which is supported by cuda than install the CPU version of torch.
5. Run python main.py

# TODO
- Make sure all outputed files are uniquely namedÂ´
- Make sure these functions work
    - Gluing and trimming midi for a certain predetermined time in seconds, implemented the ability to use templates in the file name, so only generated midis can be glued in one of 4 ways
    - Replacing notes with chords, you can set in which track or tracks to change and select a major or minor triad
    - Changing instruments by tracks

    - Convert midi to wav using various sound fonts in sf2 format. [DONE]
